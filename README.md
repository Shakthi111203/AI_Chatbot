# AI_Chatbot

This project involves creating a chatbot using Python in a Google Colab environment that can engage in text-based conversations with users. Follow these steps to run the code and interact with the chatbot:

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grafstor/simple-dialogs-for-chatbot


The dataset comprises of a dialogue set for Chatbot.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have access to a Google Colab environment. You can use Google Colab for free by visiting [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. You'll need a Google account to access Google Colab.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new Google Colab notebook.
2. We can write and run Python code in code cells and add explanations or notes in text cells.
3. To run a code cell, use the Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut.
4. Colab automatically saves our work in our Google Drive account.

## Running the Chatbot

1. Once the notebook is open, you can run each cell one by one. Make sure to execute them in sequential order.
2. The code will start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the chatbot.
3. Follow the chatbot's prompts and engage in text-based conversations with it.
